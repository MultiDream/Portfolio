		<h3> History Hex:</h3>
			<p> Throughout the games industry, much effort is placed on extracting resources from
				the earth and using them to extract more resources as you go. But they rarely
				focus on the human georgraphy component of time. When people are your most
				valuable resource, how does that change the way players interact? History
			Hex serves to answer that question. </p>
